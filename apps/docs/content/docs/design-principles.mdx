## Overview

HeroUI v3 is built on fundamental principles that prioritize clarity, accessibility, and developer experience. Every decision reflects our commitment to creating a UI library that is both powerful and intuitive.

## Core Principles

### 1. Semantic Intent Over Visual Style

We believe components should communicate their purpose, not just their appearance. HeroUI v3 uses semantic variant names that describe hierarchy and intent rather than visual properties.

#### v2 vs HeroUI v3 Approach

```tsx
// ❌ Visual-based variants (unclear intent)
<Button variant="solid" color="primary">Save</Button>
<Button variant="flat" color="primary">Edit</Button>
<Button variant="light" color="primary">Cancel</Button>

// ✅ Semantic variants (clear hierarchy)
<Button variant="primary">Save</Button>
<Button variant="secondary">Edit</Button>
<Button variant="tertiary">Cancel</Button>
```

#### Variant Hierarchy System

Inspired by [Uber's Base design system](https://base.uber.com/6d2425e9f/p/756216-button), our variants follow a clear hierarchy:

![Semantic Intent Hierarchy](https://heroui-assets.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/docs/semantic-intent.jpg)


| Hierarchy | Emphasis | Usage | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|-------|---------|
| **Primary** | High | 1 per context | The most important action to move forward in a flow, acknowledge and dismiss, or finish a task |
| **Secondary** | Medium | Many | Most actions that are in line with other content |
| **Tertiary** | Low | A few | Dismissive actions that let users cancel, skip, or exit |
| **Danger** | High (contextual) | When needed | Destructive actions that require user attention |

This pattern simplifies decision-making for both developers and AI agents by making variant selection self-descriptive and intention-based.

### 2. Accessibility as Foundation

Every component is built on [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) and the composition API is inspired by [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/overview/composition).

```tsx
// All components include proper ARIA support automatically
<Popover>
  <Button>Press me</Button>
  <Popover.Content>
    <Popover.Dialog>
      <Popover.Heading>Popover Title</Popover.Heading>
      <p className="text-muted mt-2 text-sm">
        This is the popover content. You can put any content here.
      </p>
    </Popover.Dialog>
  </Popover.Content>
</Popover>
```

**Built-in features:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Full keyboard navigation
- Screen reader optimization
- Focus management
- Touch-friendly interactions

### 3. Composition Over Configuration

Following Radix UI's proven pattern, HeroUI v3 uses compound components that provide maximum flexibility without complexity.

```tsx
// Full control through compound components
<Accordion>
  <Accordion.Item>
    <Accordion.Heading>
      <Accordion.Trigger>
        <Icon className="text-muted mr-3 size-4 shrink-0" icon={item.icon} />
        How do I place an order?
        <Accordion.Indicator>
          <Icon icon="gravity-ui:chevron-down" />
        </Accordion.Indicator>
      </Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Heading>
    <Accordion.Panel>
      <Accordion.Body>Browse our products, add items to your cart, and proceed to checkout. You'll need to provide shipping and payment information to complete your purchase.</Accordion.Body>
    </Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

**Benefits:**
- Arrange parts as needed
- Omit unnecessary elements
- Add custom content between parts
- Maintain semantic HTML structure

### 4. Progressive Disclosure

Start simple, add complexity only when needed. Components work with minimal configuration but scale to complex use cases.

```tsx
// Simple usage
<Button>Press me</Button>

// Progressive enhancement
<Button variant="primary" size="lg" isLoading>
  <Icon icon="gravity-ui:check" />
  Submit Form
</Button>

// Advanced composition
<Button asChild variant="primary">
  <Link href="/dashboard">Go to Dashboard</Link>
</Button>
```

### 5. Predictable Behavior

Components behave consistently across the library with shared patterns and conventions.

**Consistent patterns:**
- All components support `className` for styling
- Compound components use dot notation (`Component.Part`)
- State is exposed through data attributes (`data-pressed`, `data-hover`)
- Variants follow the semantic hierarchy system
- Size variants use standard naming (`sm`, `md`, `lg`)

### 6. Performance by Default

Every component is optimized for performance without sacrificing functionality.

**Optimizations:**
- Minimal re-renders through proper memoization
- Tree-shakeable exports
- CSS-in-JS free (no runtime overhead)
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Small bundle size through modular architecture

### 7. Type Safety First

Full TypeScript support ensures catch errors at compile time, not runtime.

```tsx
// Type-safe props with IntelliSense
<Button 
  variant="primary"  // ✅ Autocomplete available
  size="md"         // ✅ Type checked
  onPress={(e) => {
    // e is properly typed as PressEvent
  }}
/>
```

### 8. Separation of Styles and Logic

HeroUI v3 separates visual styles (`@heroui/styles`) from component logic (`@heroui/react`), enabling multiple implementation strategies:

#### Use Styles Anywhere

The styles package works independently, even via CDN without any JavaScript framework:

```html
<!-- Include HeroUI styles via CDN -->
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@heroui/styles@3.0.0-alpha.11/dist/heroui.min.css" 
      rel="stylesheet" 
      crossorigin="anonymous" />

<!-- Use BEM classes directly in HTML -->
<div class="space-x-2 p-4">
  <button class="button button--primary button--md">Primary</button>
  <button class="button button--secondary button--md">Secondary</button>
  <button class="button button--tertiary button--md">Tertiary</button>
  <button class="button button--danger button--md">Danger</button>
  <button class="button button--ghost button--md">Ghost</button>
</div>
```

#### Apply Styles to Any Component

Use style variants with any component through the exported variant functions:

```tsx
import { Link } from '@heroui/react';
import { buttonVariants } from '@heroui/react';

// Link component styled as a button
<Link
  className={buttonVariants({ 
    size: "md", 
    variant: "tertiary",
    className: "px-3" 
  })}
  href="https://heroui.com"
  target="_blank"
>
  HeroUI
  <Link.Icon className="h-2 w-2" />
</Link>
```

#### Multi-Framework Support

This separation enables:
- **React**: Available now as `@heroui/react`
- **Vue**: Planned - will use same `@heroui/styles`
- **Svelte**: Planned - will use same `@heroui/styles`
- **Solid**: Planned - will use same `@heroui/styles`
- **Vanilla JS**: Use styles directly with BEM classes
- **Any Framework**: Apply styles to native elements

### 10. Open and Extensible

HeroUI v3 is designed to be extended and customized for any use case.

```tsx
// Extend with custom components
function CustomButton({ intent, ...props }) {
  const variant = intent === 'cta' ? 'primary' : 'secondary';
  
  return <Button variant={variant} {...props} />;
}

// Compose with other libraries
<TooltipProvider>
  <Tooltip content="Save your work">
    <Button variant="primary">
      <Icon icon="gravity-ui:floppy-disk" />
      Save
    </Button>
  </Tooltip>
</TooltipProvider>
```

## Design Decisions

### Why Compound Components?

Compound components provide the perfect balance between flexibility and ease of use:

- **Flexibility**: Rearrange, add, or remove parts as needed
- **Clarity**: Each part has a single, clear responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one part don't affect others
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA relationships maintained automatically

### Why React Aria?

React Aria Components provides:

- Battle-tested accessibility from Adobe's Spectrum design system
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile and touch support
- Internationalization ready
- Maintained by a dedicated team

### Why Semantic Variants?

Semantic variants improve:

- **Decision making**: Clear when to use each variant
- **Consistency**: Same intent = same variant across components
- **AI-friendliness**: Self-descriptive for code generation
- **Maintenance**: Intent doesn't change with visual redesigns

## Comparison with HeroUI v2

| Aspect | HeroUI v2 | HeroUI v3 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Component Pattern** | Single components with many props | Compound components |
| **Variants** | Visual-based (solid, bordered, flat) | Semantic (primary, secondary, tertiary) |
| **Styling** | Tailwind v4 partially supported | Tailwind v4 fully supported |
| **Accessibility** | Excellent (React Aria powered) | Excellent (React Aria powered) |
| **Bundle Size** | Larger (Bundle) | Smaller (tree-shakeable) |
| **Customization Difficulty** | Medium (Props-based) | Simple (Compound components + Native CSS) |
 

We're committed to maintaining these principles while pushing the boundaries of what a modern UI library can be.
