## Design Philosophy

### Compound Components

Unlike traditional UI libraries that expose monolithic components with dozens of props, HeroUI v3 embraces the compound component pattern popularized by libraries like Radix UI. This approach provides:

- **Maximum Flexibility** - Compose components exactly how you need them
- **Cleaner APIs** - Each part has a focused, simple interface
- **Better Customization** - Style and modify individual pieces
- **Improved Accessibility** - Built-in ARIA relationships between parts

```tsx
// Traditional approach - limited flexibility
<Select 
  options={options}
  placeholder="Choose option"
  errorMessage="Required field"
  helperText="Select one option"
/>

// HeroUI v3 approach - full control
<Select>
  <Select.Label>Choose option</Select.Label>
  <Select.Trigger>
    <Select.Value placeholder="Choose option" />
    <Select.Icon />
  </Select.Trigger>
  <Select.Content>
    {options.map(option => (
      <Select.Item key={option.value} value={option.value}>
        {option.label}
      </Select.Item>
    ))}
  </Select.Content>
  <Select.Description>Select one option</Select.Description>
  <Select.ErrorMessage>Required field</Select.ErrorMessage>
</Select>
```

### Accessibility First

Every component is built on [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/), ensuring:

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** - Meet accessibility standards out of the box
- **Keyboard Navigation** - Full keyboard support for all interactions
- **Screen Reader Support** - Proper ARIA attributes and announcements
- **Focus Management** - Logical focus flow and visible focus indicators

### Unstyled by Default

HeroUI v3 components come without built-in styling, giving you complete control:

- **Any CSS Solution** - Use CSS Modules, Styled Components, Emotion, or plain CSS
- **Design System Integration** - Easily integrate with your existing design tokens
- **Framework Agnostic** - Works with any styling approach
- **Performance Focused** - No unused CSS in your bundle

## Technical Architecture

### Built on React Aria Components

React Aria Components provides the accessibility and interaction layer, while HeroUI v3 adds:

- **Compound Structure** - Breaking monolithic components into composable parts
- **Enhanced TypeScript** - Better type inference and developer experience
- **Consistent Patterns** - Unified API across all components
- **Performance Optimizations** - Minimal re-renders and optimal bundle size

### Tailwind CSS v4 Integration

While components are unstyled, HeroUI v3 provides optional Tailwind CSS v4 utilities:

- **BEM-style Classes** - Predictable class naming conventions
- **Size Variants** - Consistent sizing across components
- **State Utilities** - Hover, focus, and interaction states
- **Design Tokens** - Semantic color and spacing scales

### TypeScript Support

Full TypeScript support with:

- **Strict Type Safety** - Catch errors at compile time
- **IntelliSense** - Full autocomplete and documentation
- **Generic Components** - Type-safe polymorphic components
- **Variant Types** - Strongly typed style variants
