HeroUI is an open-source UI library with beautiful components, animations, accessibility, and great DX. Built on [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html).


## Features

- ðŸŽ¨ **Beautiful by Default** â€“ Tailwind v4 components with polished animations  
- â™¿ **Accessible** â€“ WCAG-compliant via React Aria  
- ðŸ§© **Compound Components** â€“ Flexible composition inspired by Radix UI  
- ðŸŽ¯ **TypeScript First** â€“ Predictable APIs and full type safety  
- ðŸ“¦ **Optimized Bundles** â€“ Tree-shakeable, only ship what you use  
- ðŸš€ **Future-Ready** â€“ Works seamlessly with React 19+  


## Vision

Our goal is to provide high-quality components with beautiful defaults, animations, and accessibilityâ€”separated from framework-specific code. HeroUI v3 starts with React, but the long-term vision is to support the most widely used frameworks.

We're also building for AI agents. While AI is great at coding, it struggles with design. HeroUI provides beautiful building blocks that AI (or you) can assemble into polished products. Around this, we're creating an ecosystem: HeroUI for React Native, HeroUI Chat, UI for LLMs, and more.

## Why HeroUI?

HeroUI stands out as the ideal choice for developers who value their time and want to build beautiful, accessible applications without the overhead. Here's why you should choose HeroUI:

- **Beautiful Components** â€“ Thoughtfully designed with polished animations and details
- **Ship Faster** â€“ We maintain the library and you focus on your product
- **Accessible by Default** â€“ WCAG-compliant via React Aria 
- **Modern Stack** â€“ Tailwind v4 & React 19+
- **Great DX** â€“ Full TypeScript, predictable APIs
- **Flexible** â€“ Compound component architecture
- **AI-Ready** â€“ Works seamlessly with coding assistants
- **Lightweight** â€“ Tree-shaking ensures optimized bundles
- **Actively Maintained** â€“ Ongoing updates and fixes

### Why not copy-paste?

Copy-paste libraries can feel like youâ€™re in control â€” but that control is mostly an illusion.  
At first, you grab the code, tweak a few styles, and it looks custom. But under the hood, those components often depend on a long list of libraries (`radix-ui`, `embla-carousel-react`, `react-day-picker`, and many more).  

That means **you** end up responsible for:  
- Dealing with breaking changes from hidden dependencies  
- Maintaining and updating the code yourself  
- Making sure everything works with new versions of React, Tailwind, or browsers  
- Manually patching issues whenever something breaks  


### The reality of copy-paste UIs

Most developers just want to adjust the look and feel. But copy-paste code turns that into a **full-time maintenance burden**.  

- 99% of implementations end up looking the same: same transitions, same logic, same components â€” only the colors change.  
- Thereâ€™s no real versioning. Every update means combing through diffs and fixing things manually.  
- Bug fixes and improvements donâ€™t flow back to you. Even if a PR is merged, you donâ€™t get it unless you re-copy everything.  

Copy-paste is like taking a **snapshot of a garden**. It looks nice the day you paste it, but it stops evolving â€” and over time, it withers.  


### Why HeroUI is different

HeroUI is built to grow with you:  

- ðŸ”§ **Ongoing maintenance**: bug fixes, updates, and breaking changes handled for you  
- âœ¨ **Continuous improvements**: new components, animations, and features released regularly  
- ðŸš€ **Future-proof**: always up to date with the latest React, Tailwind, and browser changes  
- ðŸŽ¨ **Deep customization**: not just theme variables â€” you can customize every slot for a completely unique look  
- ðŸ¤– **AI-friendly**: optimized for LLMs to generate clean, token-efficient code  
- ðŸŒ± **Open source community**: every fix or feature contributed flows back to all users with a simple update  


### Our belief ðŸŒ±

A UI library should be **alive** â€” evolving with the community, improving over time, and making your product better without adding maintenance overhead.  

Thatâ€™s why HeroUI lives on npm as a maintained library. You install it once, and from then on you just update to get improvements. We handle the heavy lifting, while you stay focused on building your product.  

HeroUI is not a static snapshot. Itâ€™s a garden thatâ€™s continuously watered and cared for â€” and it keeps growing with you. 

### Why React Aria over Radix?

We chose React Aria because it solves accessibility at scale with a strong community behind it. We've used it since HeroUI v2 (via hooks) and v3 keeps API conventions like `isDisabled` and `onPress`.

## Tailwind CSS

All components are built with Tailwind CSS v4, which provides a robust set of utility classes for styling. This allows you to quickly and easily customize the appearance of your components without having to write custom CSS.

## FAQ

- **Is HeroUI free?** Yes, completely free and open source.

- **Is it a full design system?** Yes, it's both a design system and a component libraryâ€”not a copy-paste kit.

- **Can I use it outside of React?** Yes, the styles can be applied to even just plain HTML. Example: [Tailwind Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/bl5fXT3rxK)

- **What frameworks are supported?** Anything that supports React is supported.

- **Does it support TypeScript?** Yes, fully typed for best DX.

- **Can I use it in my project?** Yes, for both personal and commercial projects without attribution. We'd love to see what you build thoughâ€”let us know at support@heroui.com.

- **Does it have a Figma file?** Yes, we will make it public very soon.
