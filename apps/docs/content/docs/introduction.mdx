HeroUI is an open-source UI library that brings together beautiful components, animations, accessibility, customization, and a great developer experience. Built on [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html).  

## Features

- ðŸŽ¨ **Styled by Default** - Beautiful components with Tailwind CSS v4
- â™¿ **Accessible by Default** - Built on React Aria Components
- ðŸ§© **Compound Pattern** - Flexible composition like Radix UI
- ðŸŽ¯ **TypeScript First** - Full type safety
- ðŸ“¦ **Tree-shakeable** - Bundle size includes only what you use
 

## Vision

Our vision is to provide high-quality components with beautiful default styles, animations, accessibility, and support for the most used frameworks. In v3, we separated the styles from the implementation. We started by implementing those styles in React and its frameworks, but the goal is to have support for the most widely used ones.

We're also building HeroUI not only for developers but for AI agents, as we believe AI is excellent at coding but needs help creating great user interfaces (which requires design taste). We're building beautiful component pieces that any AI model can put together to create great products. We're creating a whole ecosystem around HeroUI to give you all the software pieces you need to move faster, including HeroUI for React Native, HeroUI Chat (our platform for building UIs by prompting), UI for LLMs, and more.

## Why HeroUI?

HeroUI stands out as the ideal choice for developers who value their time and want to build beautiful, accessible applications without the overhead. Here's why you should choose HeroUI:

- **Ship Faster**: Beautiful components out of the box mean you can focus on your product logic, not UI design
- **Accessibility Without the Complexity**: Built on React Aria, you get WCAG-compliant components without becoming an accessibility expert
- **Modern Stack**: Tailwind CSS v4 and React 19+ ensure you're building with the latest technologies
- **Developer Experience First**: Full TypeScript support, predictable APIs, and excellent IDE integration
- **Flexible Architecture**: Compound component pattern gives you Radix-like flexibility with better defaults
- **AI-Ready**: Designed to work seamlessly with AI coding assistants, making development even faster
- **Zero Design Debt**: Professional design system includedâ€”no need to hire a designer for MVP
- **Optimized Bundle Size**: Tree-shaking ensures you only ship what you use

### Why not copy-paste?

We have no plans to make it copy/paste. We'd rather maintain the library: fix bugs, launch new features, handle breaking changes, update dependenciesâ€”all while you're focused on your product. When copy-pasting code, you become responsible for maintaining it. We believe most of the time you only want to modify the styles, and we provide a robust system based on plain CSS and Tailwind that allows you to modify all the slots of the components. You can also decide not to import the styles and apply your own styles to the base components.

We want to speed up the process of building a product, not slow it down by giving you more code to maintain. We're constantly shipping new features, fixing bugs, improving styles, adjusting the code to support the latest browser capabilities, updating internal dependencies, solving breaking changes, and handling many more maintenance tasks that the end user shouldn't have to do.

### Why React Aria over Radix?

We've been using React Aria even before React Aria Components, using plain hooks in HeroUI v2, and it's an amazing library created by talented people solving really difficult problems in accessibility. It's constantly maintained and driven by the open-source community. It makes the transition from HeroUI v2 to v3 simpler as we maintain the same API conventions (e.g., `isDisabled`, `onPress`). Huge thanks to [Devon Govett](https://x.com/devongovett) and the Adobe team for creating and maintaining this library.

## Tailwind CSS

All components are built with Tailwind CSS v4, which provides a robust set of utility classes for styling. This allows you to quickly and easily customize the appearance of your components without having to write custom CSS.
