HeroUI is an open-source UI library with beautiful components, animations, accessibility, and great DX. Built on [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html).


## Features

- ðŸŽ¨ **Beautiful Tailwind CSS v4 components** - Styled by default
- â™¿ **Accessible by Default** - Built on React Aria Components
- ðŸ§© **Compound Pattern** - Flexible composition similar to Radix UI
- ðŸŽ¯ **TypeScript First** - Full type safety
- ðŸ“¦ **Only ship what you use** - Tree-shakeable architecture
 

## Vision

Our goal is to provide high-quality components with beautiful defaults, animations, and accessibilityâ€”separated from framework-specific code. HeroUI v3 starts with React, but the long-term vision is to support the most widely used frameworks.

We're also building for AI agents. While AI is great at coding, it struggles with design. HeroUI provides beautiful building blocks that AI (or you) can assemble into polished products. Around this, we're creating an ecosystem: HeroUI for React Native, HeroUI Chat, UI for LLMs, and more.

## Why HeroUI?

HeroUI stands out as the ideal choice for developers who value their time and want to build beautiful, accessible applications without the overhead. Here's why you should choose HeroUI:

- **Ship Faster** â€“ Beautiful defaults, no design debt
- **Accessible by Default** â€“ WCAG-compliant via React Aria  
- **Modern Stack** â€“ Tailwind v4 & React 19+
- **Great DX** â€“ Full TypeScript, predictable APIs
- **Flexible** â€“ Compound component architecture
- **AI-Ready** â€“ Works seamlessly with coding assistants
- **Lightweight** â€“ Tree-shaking ensures optimized bundles
- **Actively Maintained** â€“ Ongoing updates and fixes

### Why not copy-paste?

We don't believe in copy-paste libraries.

With HeroUI, you get a maintained library: bug fixes, new features, updated dependencies, and browser supportâ€”all handled for you. You focus on your product. If you only want to style, our system lets you customize every slot with plain CSS or Tailwind.

### Why React Aria over Radix?

We chose React Aria because it solves accessibility at scale with a strong community behind it. We've used it since HeroUI v2 (via hooks) and v3 keeps API conventions like `isDisabled` and `onPress`.

Huge thanks to [Devon Govett](https://x.com/devongovett) and the Adobe team for their work here.

## Tailwind CSS

All components are built with Tailwind CSS v4, which provides a robust set of utility classes for styling. This allows you to quickly and easily customize the appearance of your components without having to write custom CSS.

## FAQ

- **Is HeroUI free?** Yes, completely free and open source.

- **Is it a full design system?** Yes, it's both a design system and a component libraryâ€”not a copy-paste kit.

- **Can I use it outside of React?** Yes, the styles can be applied to even just plain HTML. Example: [Tailwind Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/bl5fXT3rxK)

- **What frameworks are supported?** Anything that supports React is supported.

- **Does it support TypeScript?** Yes, fully typed for best DX.

- **Can I use it in my project?** Yes, for both personal and commercial projects without attribution. We'd love to see what you build thoughâ€”let us know at support@heroui.com.

- **Does it have a Figma file?** Yes, we will make it public very soon.
