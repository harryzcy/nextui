HeroUI is an open-source UI library with beautiful components, animations, accessibility, and great DX. Built on [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html).

Production-ready components with compound architecture, providing the building blocks for beautiful, accessible applications.


## Why HeroUI?

### Beautiful by Default
Every component ships with thoughtfully designed animations and polished details. No additional styling needed to look professional.

### Accessible
Components adhere to WAI-ARIA patterns through [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html). We handle focus management, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.

### Compound Architecture
Inspired by [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/composition), our compound component pattern gives you granular control. Access each component part individually for maximum customization.

### Developer Experience
Fully typed API with predictable patterns across all components. Get autocompletion, catch errors at build time, and enjoy consistent APIs.

### Ship Faster
We maintain the library so you can focus on your product. Just update the package to get bug fixes, new features, and improvementsâ€”no manual code changes needed.

### Optimized & Lightweight
Tree-shakeable architecture means you only ship what you use. Every component is optimized for performance.

### AI-Ready
Designed to work seamlessly with coding assistants. HeroUI provides beautiful building blocks that AI can assemble into polished products.

### Future-Proof
Built for React 19+ and Tailwind CSS v4. We stay current with the latest web standards and continuously improve.

## Vision

Our goal is to provide high-quality components with beautiful defaults, animations, and accessibilityâ€”separated from framework-specific code. HeroUI v3 starts with React, but the long-term vision is to support the most widely used frameworks.

We're building an ecosystem around this core: HeroUI for React Native, HeroUI Chat, UI for LLMs, and more. The future of UI development is here.

### Why not copy-paste?

Copy-paste libraries can feel like youâ€™re in control â€” but that control is mostly an illusion.  
At first, you grab the code, tweak a few styles, and it looks custom. But under the hood, those components often depend on a long list of libraries (`radix-ui`, `embla-carousel-react`, `react-day-picker`, and many more).  

That means **you** end up responsible for:  
- Dealing with breaking changes from hidden dependencies  
- Maintaining and updating the code yourself  
- Making sure everything works with new versions of React, Tailwind, or browsers  
- Manually patching issues whenever something breaks  


### The reality of copy-paste UIs

Most developers just want to adjust the look and feel. But copy-paste code turns that into a **full-time maintenance burden**.  

- 99% of implementations end up looking the same: same transitions, same logic, same components â€” only simple theme variables change.  
- Thereâ€™s no real versioning. Every update means combing through diffs and fixing things manually.  
- Bug fixes and improvements donâ€™t flow back to you. Even if a PR is merged, you donâ€™t get it unless you re-copy everything.  

Copy-paste is like taking a **snapshot of a garden**. It looks nice the day you paste it, but it stops evolving â€” and over time, it withers.  


### Why HeroUI is different

HeroUI is built to grow with you:  

- ðŸ”§ **Ongoing maintenance**: bug fixes, updates, and breaking changes handled for you  
- âœ¨ **Continuous improvements**: new components, animations, and features released regularly  
- ðŸš€ **Future-proof**: always up to date with the latest React, Tailwind, and browser changes  
- ðŸŽ¨ **Deep customization**: not just theme variables â€” you can customize every component slot for a completely unique look  
- ðŸ¤– **AI-friendly**: optimized for LLMs to generate clean, token-efficient code  
- ðŸŒ± **Open source community**: every fix or feature contributed flows back to all users with a simple update  


### Our belief ðŸŒ±

A UI library should be **alive** â€” evolving with the community, improving over time, and making your product better without adding maintenance overhead.  

Thatâ€™s why HeroUI lives on npm as a maintained library. You install it once, and from then on you just update to get improvements. We handle the heavy lifting, while you stay focused on building your product.  

HeroUI is not a static snapshot. Itâ€™s a garden thatâ€™s continuously watered and cared for â€” and it keeps growing with you. 

### Why React Aria over Radix?

We chose React Aria because it solves accessibility at scale with a strong community behind it. We've used it since HeroUI v2 (via hooks) and v3 keeps API conventions like `isDisabled` and `onPress`.
