HeroUI is a UI library for React that helps you build beautiful and accessible user interfaces. Created on top of [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html).

Every component is designed with care: smooth animations, polished details, and accessibility built in. It works out of the box, yet gives you the freedom to make it your own.  

We believe design should not be copied and pasted. It should evolve. HeroUI gives you components that grow with you, always improving, always up to date.

## Why HeroUI?

### Beautiful by Default

Looks professional the moment you use it. No extra styling required.

### Accessible

Accessibility is not optional. With [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html), we handle focus management, keyboard navigation, and screen readers support.

### Flexible Architecture

Each component is made of parts you can control. Change what you need. Leave the rest.

### Developer Experience

Typed APIs. Predictable patterns. Autocompletion that just works.

### Ship Faster

We maintain the library so you can focus on your product. Just update the package to get bug fixes, new features, and more. No manual code changes needed.

### Optimized & Lightweight

Tree-shaken. Only what you use goes into your app.

### AI-Ready

HeroUI v3 is designed for a future where AI writes code. Components are simple for humans and machines to assemble into great products.

### Future-Proof

Built for [React 19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19) and [Tailwind v4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4). Always improving with the web.

## Mission

We want to make world-class interfaces available to everyone. HeroUI turns complexity into simplicity. It helps you build apps that are beautiful, accessible, and effortless to use.

When you use HeroUI, you are not just moving faster. You are giving your users something that feels and performs better.

## Vision

The future of UI should not be tied to one framework. HeroUI v3 begins with React, but the goal is bigger: React Native, AI-driven design tools, and more.

We are building an ecosystem where interfaces are alive. Maintained, improved, and ready for whatever comes next.

### Why not copy-paste?

Copy-paste looks like control, but it is an illusion.
You paste code, it works for a while, then it breaks. You are left maintaining a pile of dependencies.

Most copy-paste UIs end up looking the same. They age. They stop evolving.

HeroUI is different. It is a living library:
	-	Updates and fixes flow to you automatically
	-	New features arrive without extra work
	-	Components stay current with React, Tailwind, and browsers
	-	You get deep customization, not shallow theme tweaks
	-	AI can generate clean, efficient code with HeroUI

HeroUI v3 is not a snapshot. It is a garden that keeps growing. ðŸŒ±
 
### Why React Aria over Radix?

We chose React Aria because it solves accessibility at scale with a strong community behind it.  
We've used it since HeroUI v2 (via hooks) and v3 keeps API conventions like `isDisabled` and `onPress`.  

Huge thanks to [Devon Govett](https://x.com/devongovett) and the Adobe team for their work here.
